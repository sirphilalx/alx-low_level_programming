# 0x02-functions_nested_loops

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
 - What are nested loops and how to use them
 - What is a function and how do you use functions
 - What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
 - What is a prototype
 - Scope of variables
 - What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
 - What are header files and how to to use them with #include

The files to worked on here are thusly:
1. 0-putchar.c: Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
 - The program should return 0

2. 1-alphabet.c: Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
 - Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
 - You can only use _putchar twice in your code

3. 2-print_alphabet_x10.c: Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
 - Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
 - You can only use _putchar twice in your code

4. 3-islower.c: Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
 - Prototype: int _islower(int c);
 - Returns 1 if c is lowercase
 - Returns 0 otherwise

5. 4-isalpha.c: Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
 - Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
 - Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
 - Returns 0 otherwise

6. 5-sign.c: Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
 - Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
 - Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
 - Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
 - Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

7. 6-abs.c: Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
 - Prototype: int _abs(int);

8. 7-print_last_digit.c: Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
 - Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
 - Returns the value of the last digit

9. 8-24_hours.c: Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
 - Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
 - You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)

10. 9-times_table.c: Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
 - Prototype: void times_table(void);
 - Format: see example

11. 10-add.c: Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
 - Prototype: int add(int, int);

12. 11-print_to_98.c: Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
 - Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
 - Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
 - Numbers should be printed in order
 - The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
 - The last printed number should be 98
 - You are allowed to use the standard library

13. 100-times_table.c: Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
 - Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
 - If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
 - Format: see example

14. 101-natural.c: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
 - You are allowed to use the standard library

15. 102-fibonacci.c: Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
 - The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space , 
 - You are allowed to use the standard library

16. 103-fibonacci.c: Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
 - You are allowed to use the standard library

17. 104-fibonacci.c: Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
 - The numbers should be separated by comma, followed by a space ,
 - You are allowed to use the standard library
 - You are not allowed to use any other library (You can’t use GMP etc…)
 - You are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures
 - You are not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except for 1 and 2)
