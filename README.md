# alx-low_level_programming
In learning how to program, this is one of the courses I had to deal with in alx. I have to learn low level programming with a major in the C language. Under here, I will list the different modules in this course and each module has several other tasks to be done within a deadline. The learning here is sporadic.

## Modules

- 0x01-variables_if_else_while
- 0x02-C_Functions_nested_loops
- 0x03-C_Debugging
- 0x04-C_More_functions_more_nested_loops
- 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
- 0x06-C_More_pointers_arrays_and_strings
- 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
- 0x08-recursion
- 0x09-static_libraries
- 0x0A-argc_argv
- 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
- 0x0D-preprocessor
