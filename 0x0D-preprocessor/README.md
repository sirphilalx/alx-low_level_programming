## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
 - What are macros and how to use them
 - What are the most common predefined macros

## The tasks and files here are the following:

1. 0-object_like_macro.h: Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
2. 1-pi.h:Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
3. Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
    - You are allowed to use the standard library
4. 3-function_like_macro.h: Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
5. 4-sum.h: Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
